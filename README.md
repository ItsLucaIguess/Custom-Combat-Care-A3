# Custom-Combat-Care-A3
Custom Combat Care (C3) is a modular and lightweight medical framework for Arma 3, designed by mixing and refining mechanics I personally enjoy from other medical systems and games. Rather than replicating the complexity of systems like ACE, this mod offers a streamlined yet immersive alternative that supports both casual and tactical gameplay styles.
Whether you're looking to add meaningful downed states, realistic stabilization and revival mechanics, or just want a more flexible approach to player injury and recovery, C3 aims to give you the tools without the bloat.

# KEY FEATURES (WIP)
- Carrying and dragging of downed players (WIP)
- Stabilization before revival to increase immersion and team play (WIP)
- Localized damage handling for limbs (WIP)
## -------------------- PLANNED FEATURES -----------------------
- Configurable instant death chance via CBA settings 
- Modular design with optional features:
- Downed self-interactions (e.g. self-revive, martyrdom)
- Custom HP values per unit via CBA or init fields

This mod is a work-in-progress and intended to be both easy to integrate and fun to expand upon. Feedback and contributions are welcome!
